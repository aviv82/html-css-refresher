    <h1>html basics</h1>
    <h2>interneting is easy!</h2>
    <p>first we need to learn some basic html</p>
    <h3>headings</h3>
    <p>
      headings define the outline of your site. there are six levels of headings
    </p>
    <h3>lists</h3>
    <p>this is how you make an unordered list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>add a 'ul' element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>add each item in its own 'li' element</li>
      <li>they don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>this is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>notice the new 'ol' element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>but the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>
        you should be noting things in this precise order because this is an
        ordered list
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>inline elements</h3>

    <p>
      <em>sometimes</em> you need to draw attention to a particular word or
      phrase
    </p>
    <p>
      other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
      of a word or phrase
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>and sometimes you need to shout</strong></em>
    </p>

    <h3>empty elements</h3>
